# Hash-Function-Optimization
Implement a hash function and optimize the function's performance to reduce the need for rehashing when inserting elements. Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Nelder-Mead are the optimization techniques that will be used to find an optimal set of parameters for the hash function to reduce collisions and improve efficiency.
